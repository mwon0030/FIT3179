                        This visualisation shows the location of each shot a player took throughout the 2015-16 regular season,
                        which means finals and all-star games are excluded from the dataset. Initially, the chart will be blank
                        as no player has been selected yet. Upon selecting a player, all the shot locations of that player will
                        loaded onto the chart. The legend on the top right shows which colour denotes a scored or missed shot. The
                        longest shot attempted is annotated for each player. Hovering over each point also provides more information
                        about the shot, such as the action that was used to take the shot, what type of shot it was, and the shot zone.
                        <br><br>
                        The differences between each player's shot chart generally reflect the position they play. Point guards and 
                        shooting guards such as Stephen Curry and Danny Green spend a lot of their time outside of the three-point arc 
                        (the large arc line), which is why many of their shots are behind the three-point line. Power forwards and centers 
                        such as Blake Griffin and Rudy Gobert play mostly inside the three-point arc and the key (the rectangle inside 
                        the three-point line), which is reflected in their respective shot charts. Not only can positional differences be 
                        observed, but also each player's play style, for example with Lebron James, most of his shots are taken on the 
                        left side of the court.

                        This visualisation shows how a team's offence and defence has changed throughout the first 30 games of the season.
                        The calculation for offensive and defensive rating is complicated, however they essentially represent how efficient
                        a team's offence or defence is, where a higher rating is better. The lines show the progression of each team 
                        throughout the first 30 games, and the points represent where each team is offensively and defensively rated after each
                        game they have played. The rating values shown are a 10 game moving average as this is a better way to visualise 
                        how a team is tracking, since all teams will experience a large variance in performance throughout a long 82 game
                        season. The legend on the top right denotes which colour is associated with which team. The drop down list on the
                        bottom can be used to display all teams or one team at a time. Hovering over a point will reveal which game
                        number the team has just played. The annotations highlight the first game and the 30th game played. 
                        <br><br>
                        From the three teams shown, each team has improved in some capacity from where they started. The Cavaliers improved
                        by 7 offensive rating points while their defensive rating has dropped 2 points. The Rockets have significantly
                        improved their offence by 22 points however their defence has receded by 5 points. The Warriors are the only team
                        that improved in both offence and defence by gaining 8 and 3 points respectively. Both the Cavaliers and the Rockets
                        experienced large improvements early on in the season, however the Cavaliers started to drop off after game 15 and
                        the Rockets began to decline after game 25.

                        This visualisation shows how skilled a player is in one aspect of the game in comparison to other players. The radar line
                        chart makes it easy to compare many categories at once by placing each category equidistantly.
                        The larger the area of the radar, the more well rounded a player is, and the closer the tip of the radar is to the labelled
                        category, the better the player is in that statistic. The statistics shown are points (PTS), rebounds (REB), assists
                        (AST), steals (STL) and blocks (BLK). Points are the points gained by scoring a shot, rebounds are acquired by being the
                        first to possess the ball after a missed shot, assists are given when a teammate scores directly after they were passed the ball, steals
                        are when a player takes possession of the ball off an opponent and blocks are given when a player blocks an opponents'
                        shot while they are in their shooting motion. The numbers annotated on the graph are the average number of that statistic a
                        player has accumulated per game. This average is taken over the entire regular season. The legend shows which colour is 
                        associated with which player. 
                        <br><br>
                        The differences between the two players can be explained by their difference of position and physique. Russell Westbrook
                        is a point guard who is responsible for distributing the ball to their teammates. Typically this means they have more
                        possession of the ball which allows them to score more points as well as pass the ball to teammates to give them the opportunity 
                        to score leading to more assists. Rudy Gobert is a center who is responsible for rebounding the ball and protecting 
                        close range shots. They are generally the tallest players in the team which makes it easier for them to rebound the ball
                        as well as block their opponents' shots.

                        This visualisation shows the distribution of the height and weight of active NBA players. The weight is measured in 
                        kilograms (KG) while the height is measured in centimeters (CM). The legend shows a color scale that represents the
                        number of players for each height and weight range. Hovering over a rectangle on the chart will reveal the exact number
                        of players for the given height and weight range.
                        <br><br>
                        From the visualisation, a majority of the players are within 190-215 centimeters tall and 85-115 kilograms heavy. The highest
                        number of players within a height and weight range has 44 players within 195-200CM and 95-100KG. The tallest and heaviest 
                        active NBA player is in a class of his own standing between 225-230CM tall and weighing 140-145KG.
